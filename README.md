# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose: 
### We will design an AI for the game using Python. Then two AI will simulating the game thousands of times.

(be sure to read the instructions given in course Moodle)

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
### Different first move, Different AI, Additional rules 


List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
### The best first move might be placing stone in the center. 
### The further your first move away from the center, the less winning rate you will get.

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:
