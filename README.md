### Monte Carlo.ppt: This is the powerpoint for the presentation.
### play_with_AI.py : This is the python program in which you can play with a AI with tree depth of 3
### graphics.py: This is a py file which provide graphics and source of user interfaces. This is a copy of other's code
### simulation.py: This is the py file for Monte Carlo simulation. The program simulating 100 games a time using 2 AIs.

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose: 
### We will design an AI for the game using Python. Then two AI will simulating the game thousands of times.

(be sure to read the instructions given in course Moodle)

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
### Different first move, Different AI, Additional rules 


List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
### The best first move might be placing stone in the center. 
### The further your first move away from the center, the less winning rate you will get.

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:
