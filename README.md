# 590PR Final_Project
Fork from here to create your final project repository.

Two things are different than all the previous assignments in 590PR regarding the permissions settings:

1. Please KEEP the "All_Students" team to have Read access.  
2. Whenever you choose to, you are welcome to change your Final Project repository to private or to public.  This will enable you to list it in your resume, website, or other portfolio.

TEMPLATE for your report to fill out:

# Title: Best way to throw a ball.

## Team Member(s): 
Xianzhuo Cao, Xiaoxin Wang, Wendi Zhang

(Note: Don't put your email addresses here (which is public).  If a student wants their NAME hidden as well, due to optional FERPA regulations, they can be listed purely by their GitHub ID).

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose: 
By throwing the ball tens of thousands of times, to find out the best to throw the ball to the farest(like discus throwing in Olympics)

(be sure to read the instructions given in course Moodle)

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
People: Different people have different strength in throwing the ball.
The size of the ball:
The material of the ball: air friction will have different influence on different material.
The wind: The speed and the direction of the wind.
the angle in throwing the ball:

bonus: It might be difficult to take the shape of the good into control. For example, if it is a cuboid rather than a ball.
We might have to consider about its rotation in motion. But we might try it after everything is done.


List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
The best angle might be around 45Â°. 
The material that have greatest density might perform the best.
The best angle might change due to different wind.

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:
