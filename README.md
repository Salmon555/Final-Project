# 590PR Final_Project
Fork from here to create your final project repository.

Two things are different than all the previous assignments in 590PR regarding the permissions settings:

1. Please KEEP the "All_Students" team to have Read access.  
2. Whenever you choose to, you are welcome to change your Final Project repository to private or to public.  This will enable you to list it in your resume, website, or other portfolio.

TEMPLATE for your report to fill out:

# Title: A Chess Game: Five in a row

## Team Member(s): Xianzhuo Cao, Xiaoxin Wang, Wendi Zhang

(Note: Don't put your email addresses here (which is public).  If a student wants their NAME hidden as well, due to optional FERPA regulations, they can be listed purely by their GitHub ID).

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose: 
### We will design an AI for the game using Python. Then two AI will simulating the game thousands of times.

(be sure to read the instructions given in course Moodle)

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
### Different first move, Different AI, Additional rules 


List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
### The best first move might be placing stone in the center. 
### The further your first move away from the center, the less winning rate you will get.

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:
